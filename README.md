## TSP datasets and results for our TSP paper (in press with the SN Operations Research Forum, details will be updated) 
 
--- 

## The directory names are self-explanatory: 

* data: TSPLIB and other datasets all in TSPLIB format  
* distr-fit-results-plots: Contains text files for the statistical test results and
CDF, density, PP, and QQ plots for fit-distribution analysis  
* edge-dist-histograms: The barplot histograms of the edge distances from the distance matrix (eps files)
The eps plots contain statistics on the title for the mean, median, standard deviation, skewness, 
and kurtosis of the edge distances  
* results: csv files generated from the benchmarks  
* src: Source codes used in benchmarks 
* vertex-config: The plot of vertices on the coordinate axis (eps file)
